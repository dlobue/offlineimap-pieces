why am i stuck in offlineimap? what next?

okay, i want to be able to queue a message for work as soon as I know what to do with it. in order to do this i need to implement the threadpool.

in order to implement the threadpool I need to implement the connection handler/dispatcher as well as the remaining data models.
 -what data models am i missing? what do i already have?

in order to implement the connection handler I need a reliable and automatic to use sasl
and i need to finish implementing the connection logic
